# Grafana integration with locust using prometheus
 
## Documentation
There are two yaml files in this directory  

    - one to configure and deploy the whole setup including locust 
    - one to configure prometheus

I've intentionally left the locustfile.py along with requirements.txt blank, since each application is different and the requests should be handcrafted for each case.

Feel free to use it, comment on it and let me know if there's an issue with the script. 

* Do not specify containerName for worker, doing so might prevent the worker from being scaled. 



## Command Line

```bash
  docker-compose --build up -d --scale workers=4 
```
